a) Run test 6
b) No. As the session A is doing a transaction the changes won't be applied
   until the transaction is committed. And as the transaction on B started before
   the database changed, the information on B keeps unchanged.
c) If we try to alter the information inserted on A, the session B gets blocked.
   This block continues until the transaction on A is committed, then, the changes are
   made on the session B but they won't be applied until it ends with a commit.
   This happens because the A session has a write lock on the table bookings,
   this lock doesn't allow to the session B to continue. The lock is freed when
   session A commits the changes, and with this B can continue with the task.
