a) Run test 6
b) No. As the session A is doing a transaction the changes won't be applied
   untill the transaction is commited. And as the transaction on B started before
   the database changed, the information on B keeps unchanged.
c) If we try to alter the information inserted on A, the session B gets blocked.
   This block continues until the transaction on A is commmited, then, the changes are
   made on te session B but they won't be applied until it ends with a commit.
