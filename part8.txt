a) How can you protect the credit card information in the database from hackers?
   If we store credit card information in our database as plain text and someone
   has access to it (a hacker, a system administrator...) the credit cards can
   be compromised and leaked or sold on the Internet.

   To avoid this, we can encrypt the credit card information. There are many
   algorithms to encrypt information, but as the credit card information will
   be used once it's stored, we have to use a two way encryption algorithm.

   A well known two way encryption algorithm is AES (with different key sizes:
   128, 192 or 256 bits). AES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the
   information. This way, if we create a secure AES-256 key and encrypt all the
   credit card information with it, we should be safe. The key must be stored
   safely as if an attacker gets access to it he/she could decrypt all the
   encrypted information.

b) Give three advantages of using stored procedures in the database (and thereby
   execute them on the server) instead of writing the same functions in the frontend
   of the system (in for example java-script on a web-page)?

   1-. Security:
        Using stored procedures can limit the access the application has to the
        database only allowing the necessary interactions.
   2-. Performance:
       The SQL server will always be faster executing stored procedures as the
       server has all the stored procedures in cache.
   3-. Maintainability:
       If a query on the database has to be changed, there is no need to change
       the application itself, we just have to change the stored procedure.
       This means that we don't need to compile the application again or force the
       users to download a patch.
